## Project Architecture

This is a **Universal Price List Generator** - a Node.js/Express Shopify app that allows ANY business to create professional, branded price lists and catalogs. Currently deployed and working on Render with basic functionality. We are enhancing it with improved PDF aesthetics and innovative PDF-to-order conversion via QR codes.

### Core Components

**Main Application (`src/index.js`)**
- Single-file Express server with embedded ShopifyService class
- Handles both API endpoints and frontend routes
- Serves static HTML pages with embedded JavaScript
- Contains the main pricing calculation logic
- **NEW**: QR code generation endpoints
- **NEW**: Enhanced PDF export with clickable links

**Database Layer (`src/database.js`)**
- MongoDB connection using Mongoose
- Async connection handling with detailed error reporting
- Connection pooling and timeout configuration

### Current Working Features

**Pricing System** ✅
- **4 Pricing Tiers**: Retail (0%), Wholesale (15%), Installer (20%), Distributor (25%)
- **Custom Price Overrides**: Individual product pricing with visual indicators
- **Real-time Calculations**: Dynamic updates based on tier selections
- **Bulk Operations**: Apply tier pricing to selected products

**Enhanced PDF Generation** ✅

### Development Notes

**Current Architecture**
- **ES Modules**: Uses `"type": "module"` in package.json
- **Single Server File**: Main logic in `src/index.js` with embedded ShopifyService class
- **Working OAuth**: Express + @shopify/shopify-api (proven deployment on Render)
- **Mock Data**: Falls back to sample products when Shopify not configured
- **Static Serving**: HTML/CSS/JS served from `src/public/`
- **Tailwind CSS**: Served from CDN (no build step required)

**PDF Generation Details**
- **Library**: jsPDF for client-side PDF generation
- **Current Fields**: Product name, model, capacity, voltage, dimensions, price, vendor, stock
- **Enhancement Goal**: Remove vendor/stock, add clickable links, improve aesthetics

**Pricing Logic**
- **Base Price**: From Shopify product data
- **Tier Discounts**: Applied as percentage reduction
- **Custom Overrides**: Individual product price changes
- **Visual Indicators**: Shows when custom pricing applied

**Safe Enhancement Strategy**
- **Add New Files**: Don't modify existing working code initially
- **Branch Development**: Use feature branches for testing
- **Gradual Integration**: Enhance incrementally without breaking functionality
- **Rollback Capability**: Can revert to working state if needed

### Testing Shopify Connection

Use the `/api/shopify/debug` endpoint to test and troubleshoot Shopify connectivity. The application will fall back to mock data if Shopify is not configured.

### Current API Endpoints

**Working Endpoints** ✅
- `/api/shopify/debug` - Test Shopify connectivity and troubleshoot
- `/api/shopify/products` - Fetch products with pagination and search
- `/api/shopify/shop` - Get shop information
- Basic product filtering and pricing calculation endpoints

**Planned API Endpoints** 📋
- `POST /api/generate-qr` - Generate QR codes for checkout URLs
- `POST /api/draft-orders/create-draft-order` - Create Shopify draft order from price list
- `POST /api/draft-orders/create-cart-permalink` - Generate cart URLs with custom pricing
- `GET /api/draft-orders/check-conversion/:id` - Track order conversion rates
- `GET /api/health-check` - Verify required dependencies

### Current Dependencies

**Working (package.json)**
```json
{
  "type": "module",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.x",
    "mongoose": "^7.x.x", 
    "dotenv": "^16.x.x",
    "@shopify/shopify-api": "^latest",
    "qrcode": "^1.5.4"
  }
}
```

### Common Development Tasks

**Enhance PDF Features**:
- Modify `enhanced-pdf.js` (new file) for layout changes
- Update PDF generation integration in existing `src/index.js`
- Test PDF output matches design requirements

**Add Company Configuration**:
- Implement `company-config.js` (new file) for UI components  
- Add configuration modal to existing HTML pages
- Integrate with existing pricing logic

**Implement QR Features**:
- Create QR generation endpoints in `src/index.js`
- Enhance `draft-orders.js` for Shopify Draft Orders integration
- Add QR code display to PDF generation

**Database Changes**:
- Update models in `src/models/` (if they exist)
- Modify connection logic in `src/database.js` if needed
- Consider price list history storage

### Safe Implementation Strategy

**Phase-by-Phase Approach**
1. **Create New Files**: Add functionality without modifying working code
2. **Test Locally**: Verify each enhancement works independently  
3. **Gradual Integration**: Slowly incorporate new features into existing workflow
4. **Branch Protection**: Use feature branches, merge only when tested
5. **Rollback Ready**: Can revert to current working state if needed

**Key Files to Preserve**
- `src/index.js` - Main server (enhance gradually)
- `src/public/index.html` - Working frontend (add new features)
- `src/public/app.js` - Existing JavaScript (extend, don't replace)
- Environment variables and deployment configuration

This ensures the currently working price list generator remains functional while we add enhanced features.

### Business Context & Vision

**Current Product**: Universal price list generator for Shopify merchants
**Target Users**: B2B/wholesale businesses, installers, distributors
**Key Innovation**: PDF-to-order conversion via QR codes (planned - would be first of its kind)

**Market Opportunity**
- Large Shopify ecosystem with wholesale/B2B segment
- Current competitors offer basic price list generation only
- Our planned QR checkout feature would be unique differentiator

**Development Priorities**
1. **Complete Enhanced PDF** - Professional aesthetics, company/client separation
2. **QR Integration** - Draft Orders API and checkout workflows  
3. **Polish & Testing** - Ensure reliability before broader release
4. **Shopify App Store** - Prepare for public distribution when ready

- Automatic fallback to mock checkout if Shopify not configured
- Client information captured and passed to draft orders
- Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation

**🔧 REQUIREMENTS FOR LIVE DRAFT ORDERS**

**Environment Variables Required:**
```
SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_private_app_access_token
SHOPIFY_SHOP_NAME=your-shop-name (without .myshopify.com)
```

**Shopify App Scopes Required:**
- `read_products` ✅ (already have)
- `write_draft_orders` ⚠️ (need to add)
- `read_orders` (optional - for tracking)

**How to Enable Real Draft Orders:**
1. Go to your Shopify Admin → Apps → App and sales channel settings
2. Click "Develop apps" → Select your app
3. Add `write_draft_orders` scope to your app configuration
4. Regenerate access token with new scopes
5. Update `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable
6. Restart application

**⚠️ CURRENT LIMITATION:**
- Without `write_draft_orders` scope, system uses mock checkout URLs
- Mock URLs work for testing but don't create actual Shopify orders
- With proper scopes, system creates real draft orders that appear in Shopify admin

**🔄 WORKFLOW STATUS:**
- ✅ Quote generation working
- ✅ QR code generation working  
- ✅ Checkout URL creation working
- ⚠️ Real draft order creation requires scope update
- ✅ Fallback system prevents crashes

**🎯 NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE INTEGRATION:**
1. Add `write_draft_orders` scope to Shopify app
2. Test draft order creation in Shopify admin
3. Verify draft orders appear in Shopify dashboard
4. Test customer invoice URL workflow
